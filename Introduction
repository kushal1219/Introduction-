Determine a program for an event
Introduction
ABC is a company based in Toronto for organizing events, currently it works on a project to organize an
event for 7 days for a group of photographers from all over the world.
The company has to determine a good program, including a hotel of residence, a hall for meetings, places
of landscape to visit, places of shopping, restaurants and cafes.
The company has to make a list of places of landscape in Toronto, including the nearest restaurants,
cafes, and shopping stores for each place. And it has to provide a map in case the photographer canâ€™t use
his/here mobile application for any reason.
